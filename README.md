# Minimalistic HTTP Webserver  
A minimalistic http web server written in C for a class project  
capable of GET, POST, PUT, and HEAD.  

There is currently no security  
images and folders tend to break  

made primarily for learning, but I thought it was interesting enough to save  

to compile,  
`make -f makeserver`  
then you can run  
`./staticHTTPserver <port number>`  

why is it static? because originally I was just going to impliment GET,  
but unfortunately I'm a perfectionist
